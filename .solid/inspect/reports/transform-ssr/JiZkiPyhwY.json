These advanced languages offer a range of expressive features to allow robust, reusable and high-performing software codes to be safely and rapidly developed. This course will cover key programming techniques of typed functional programming that are becoming widely adopted, such as strong typing, code composition and abstraction, effect handlers, and safe techniques for asynchronous and concurrent programming.</p><p><strong>Semesters taught</strong>: AY24/25 Semester 1</p></div><div class=\\\"box\\\"><h2>IT5100B</h2><p><strong>Industry Readiness: Stream Processing</strong></p><p>The global availability of data has reached a level where aggregating data into generic, general-purpose \\u201Cstores\\u201D is no longer feasible. Having data collections statically available for querying by interested parties on demand is increasingly becoming the way of the past. Instead, a new paradigm, called Data Streaming, has emerged recently. In this paradigm, data is bundled into high-throughput \\\"streams\\\" that are sharded efficiently across a large number of network nodes. Consumers, sometimes counted in hundreds of thousands, or millions, \\\"subscribe\\\" to data subsets and are notified when new data becomes available, being under the obligation to process it immediately, or lose it. Consequently, data storage is no longer centralized, but rather distributed into many smaller-sized abstract collections. This new approach to \\\"Big Data\\\" requires a new set of tools, platforms, and solution patterns. In this course we propose to explore several facets of this new paradigm:</p><ul><li>The Stream paradigm introduced in Java 8.</li><li>Platforms that implement Data Streaming, such as Kafka, and the Java bindings in the library KafkaConnect.</li><li>Computing paradigms for stream processing, such as Reactive Programming, and the library RxJava.</li><li>High-performance stream computing platforms, such as Flink.</li></ul><p>The course will be using Java as the main vehicle for introducing concepts and showcasing examples.</p><p><strong>Semesters taught</strong>: AY23/24 Semester 2, AY24/25 Semester 2</p></div></div><div class=\\\"flex-row\\\"><div class=\\\"box left\\\"><h2>IT5100E</h2><p><strong>Industry Readiness: Security Best Practices</strong></p><p>Malicious exploitation of vulnerable applications running on the web can have disastrous consequences.
