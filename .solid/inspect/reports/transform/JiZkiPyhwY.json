These advanced languages offer a range of expressive features to allow robust, reusable and high-performing software codes to be safely and rapidly developed. This course will cover key programming techniques of typed functional programming that are becoming widely adopted, such as strong typing, code composition and abstraction, effect handlers, and safe techniques for asynchronous and concurrent programming.</p><p><strong>Semesters taught</strong>: AY24/25 Semester 1</p></div><div class=box><h2>IT5100B</h2><p><strong>Industry Readiness: Stream Processing</strong></p><p>The global availability of data has reached a level where aggregating data into generic, general-purpose “stores” is no longer feasible. Having data collections statically available for querying by interested parties on demand is increasingly becoming the way of the past. Instead, a new paradigm, called Data Streaming, has emerged recently. In this paradigm, data is bundled into high-throughput \"streams\" that are sharded efficiently across a large number of network nodes. Consumers, sometimes counted in hundreds of thousands, or millions, \"subscribe\" to data subsets and are notified when new data becomes available, being under the obligation to process it immediately, or lose it. Consequently, data storage is no longer centralized, but rather distributed into many smaller-sized abstract collections. This new approach to \"Big Data\" requires a new set of tools, platforms, and solution patterns. In this course we propose to explore several facets of this new paradigm:</p><ul><li>The Stream paradigm introduced in Java 8.</li><li>Platforms that implement Data Streaming, such as Kafka, and the Java bindings in the library KafkaConnect.</li><li>Computing paradigms for stream processing, such as Reactive Programming, and the library RxJava.</li><li>High-performance stream computing platforms, such as Flink.</li></ul><p>The course will be using Java as the main vehicle for introducing concepts and showcasing examples.</p><p><strong>Semesters taught</strong>: AY23/24 Semester 2, AY24/25 Semester 2</p></div></div><div class=flex-row><div class=\"box left\"><h2>IT5100E</h2><p><strong>Industry Readiness: Security Best Practices</strong></p><p>Malicious exploitation of vulnerable applications running on the web can have disastrous consequences. This module aims to introduce application security considerations and provide practical experience on secure coding practices, focusing on web-based applications. Topics covered include fundamental security concepts (e.g., encryption, authentication, authorization), secure coding practices (e.g., handling of cookies, passwords, errors), secure design and deployment principles (e.g., threat modelling, vulnerability scanning), along with industry standards (e.g., OWASP), tools, common threats and defense against them.</p><p><strong>Semesters taught</strong>: AY23/24 Semester 1, AY24/25 Semester 2</p></div><div class=box><h2>IT5001</h2><p><strong>Software Development Fundamentals</strong></p><p>This module aims to introduce non-computing students to the principles and concepts of software development at an accelerated pace. Students will be introduced to the basics of programming (control flow, code and data abstraction, recursion, types, OO), development methodology (ensuring correctness, testing, debugging), simple data structures and algorithms (lists, maps, sorting), and software engineering principles. Through hands on assignments and projects, students will learn good software development practices (documentation, style) and experience a typical software engineering cycle.</p><p><strong>Semesters taught</strong>: AY20/21 Semester 2, AY21/22 Semester 1, AY21/22 Semester 2, AY22/23 Semester 1, AY22/23 Semester 2, AY23/24 Semester 2</p></div></div><div class=flex-row><div class=\"box left\"><h2>CS1010E</h2><p><strong>Programming Methodology</strong></p><p>This module introduces the fundamental concepts of problem solving by computing and programming using an imperative programming language.

Students will also learn to quantify the space and time complexity of an algorithm, prove the correctness of an algorithm, and the limits of computation.
