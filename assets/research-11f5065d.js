However, earlier efforts to do so are unable to work with incomplete programs containing parametrically polymorphic types. </p><p>In this paper, we present a technique that receives an incomplete Java program that may contain parametrically polymorphic types, and reconstructs its surrounding dependencies to form a complete and well-typed program. We then present empirical results from our prototype implementation of this algorithm, JavaCIP, which outperforms prior works in this area.</p><p><a href="../papers/javacip/Reconstruction of Incomplete Polymorphic Programs.pdf">Submitted Author's Copy (Under Review) </a> | <a href=../papers/javacip/Poster.pdf>Poster`);function h(){return(()=>{const e=a(c),o=e.firstChild,[t,r]=n(o.nextSibling);return t.nextSibling,i(e,s(p,{children:"Research - Foo Yong Qi"}),t,r),e})()}export{h as default};
