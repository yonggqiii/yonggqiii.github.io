However, earlier efforts to do so are unable to work with incomplete programs containing parametrically polymorphic types. </p><p>In this paper, we present a technique that receives an incomplete Java program that may contain parametrically polymorphic types, and reconstructs its surrounding dependencies to form a complete and well-typed program. We then present empirical results from our prototype implementation of this algorithm, JavaCIP, which outperforms prior works in this area.</p><p><a href="../papers/javacip/Reconstruction of Incomplete Polymorphic Programs.pdf">Submitted Author's Copy (Under Review) </a> | <a href=../papers/javacip/Poster.pdf>Poster</a></p><!$><!/></div><div class=box><h2>Motivating Mathematics Study in Prospective Computer Scientists with Interactive Theorem Provers</h2><p>The Curry-Howard correspondence shows that terms, types, programs and program evaluation correspond to witnesses, propositions, proofs and proof normalization in (intuitionistic) logic. This has spawned a large body of work in the literature known as <em>proof assistants</em> or <em>interactive theorem provers</em> that exploit this correspondence via a programming language with a type system that supports proof checking.</p><p>On the other hand, the need to study mathematics may not be immediately apparent to budding software engineers, particularly those aiming to enter industry post-study. Our aim is motivate students to study mathematics by showing that the art of writing programs is the same as the art of writing a proof. We do so by writing both proofs and programs in Lean 4.</p><!$><!/></div></div><div class="box solo"><h2>Optimizing SYB Traversals via Specialization</h2><p>Scrap Your Boilerplate (SYB) supports generic traversals to eliminate boilerplate code, but suffers from poor performance.
