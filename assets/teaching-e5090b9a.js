Having data collections statically available for querying by interested parties on demand is increasingly becoming the way of the past. Instead, a new paradigm, called Data Streaming, has emerged recently. In this paradigm, data is bundled into high-throughput "streams" that are sharded efficiently across a large number of network nodes. Consumers, sometimes counted in hundreds of thousands, or millions, "subscribe" to data subsets and are notified when new data becomes available, being under the obligation to process it immediately, or lose it. Consequently, data storage is no longer centralized, but rather distributed into many smaller-sized abstract collections. This new approach to "Big Data" requires a new set of tools, platforms, and solution patterns.
